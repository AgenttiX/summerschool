# Machine Learning

- algorithms that learn patterns from data to make predictions on unseen data


  **The unreasonable effectiveness of data in machine learning!**

# Overfitting, Generalization, Regularization

- quality of a model is measured on new, unseen samples
- models with too many parameters can overfit to training data
- overfitting can be prevented

# Artificial Neurons

# Neural Networks

# Pytorch Example

# Learning as an Optimization Problem

# Forward Pass

# Backward Pass


# Summary
