# Parallel calculation of Ï€

Starting from the serial code or your solution from [the earlier parallel pi exercise](../parallel-pi-two-procs), make a version
that performs the calculation parallel with any number of processes.

1. Divide the range over N in `ntasks`, so that rank 0 does i=1, 2, ..., N / ntasks, rank 1 does
   i=N / ntasks + 1, N / ntasks + 2, ... , *etc.*. You
   may assume that N is evenly divisible by the number of processes.

2. All tasks calculate their own partial sums

3. Once finished with the calculation, all ranks except rank 0 send their partial sum to rank 0,
   which then calculates the final result and prints it out.

4. Run the code with different number of processes, do you get **exactly** the same
   result? If not, can you explain why?

5. Make a version where rank 0 receives the partial sums with `MPI_ANY_SOURCE`. When running
  multiple times with the same number of processes, do you get always **exactly** the same result?
  If not, can you explain why?

6. (Bonus) Make a version that works with arbitrary number of processes. Now,
  if N cannot be divided evenly by `ntasks`, some processes
  calculate more terms than others.
