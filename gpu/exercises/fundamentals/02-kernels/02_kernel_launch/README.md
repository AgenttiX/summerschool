After compiling the code, run it by giving it two arguments:
- number of blocks
- number of threads

For example
- `./a.out 1 1` runs the code with 1 block and 1 thread
- `./a.out 1 8` runs the code with 1 block and 8 threads
- `./a.out 10 1024` runs the code with 10 blocks and 1024 threads

First try to run it with a small number of blocks and threads to make sense of the output.

What does the output look like, if your input is 2 blocks and 2 threads?

Finally, try running it with 1025 threads. What happens? Is the output as expected?
