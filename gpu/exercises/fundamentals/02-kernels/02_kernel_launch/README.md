After compiling the code, run it by giving it two arguments:
- number of blocks
- number of threads

Try running it with the following arguments:
- 1 1: one block, one thread
- 1 2: one block, two threads
- 2 1: two blocks, one thread
- 1 10: one block, ten threads
- 10 1: ten blocks, one thread
- 10 10: ten blocks, ten threads

Finally, try running it with 10 blocks and 1025 threads. What happens? Is the output as expected?
