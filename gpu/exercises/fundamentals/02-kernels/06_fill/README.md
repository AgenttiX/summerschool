Your job is to fill an array with a constant value on the GPU using a kernel.

You may begin with the [provided skeleton](main.cpp) and fill in the TODOs.

You can consult the earlier exercises where we launched kernels and the lecture slides.
The slides will be helpful with allocating memory, copying it and computing the indices in the kernel.
